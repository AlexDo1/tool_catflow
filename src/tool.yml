      title: Create a CATFLOW geometry file from .tif files using the method of representative hillslopes (Loritz et al 2017).

        Hillslope wizard developed by Ralf Loritz (2015)
        Delination of 2D catenas from hillslopes. The idea behind this code is based on a approach from Francke et al. 2006 (Automated 
        catena-based discretization of landscapes for the derivation of hydrological modelling 
        units) and Cochrane and Flanagan (2003).
        The idea behind this approach is to select every unique distance and their corrosponding 
        elevation from a river inside a hillslope. If more than one raster cell have the same 
        distance the elevation is calculated by a weighted mean using the flow accumulation. The 
        hillslope width can be estimated by the frequency of the appearance of a single distance.
