  write_precip:
    title: CATFLOW precipitation time series
    description: |
      CATFLOW requires a precipitation record from which the rainfall intensities 
      are interpolated between discrete time steps; rainfall intensities are thus 
      only needed at those time steps when they are changing.
      This tool converts a regular rainfall record (intensity at uniform time
      intervals), to CATFLOW specific format.
