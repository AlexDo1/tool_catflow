    description: |
      Hillslope wizzard developed by Ralf Loritz (2015)
      Delination of 2D catenas from hillslopes. The hillslope, dist2river, elev2river and 
      accumulation maps were extracted using QGIS in combination Grass GIS and SAGA GIS. 
      The idea behind this code is based on a approach from Francke et al. 2006 (Automated 
      catena-based discretization of landscapes for the derivation of hydrological modelling 
      units) and Cochrane and Flanagan (2003).
      The idea behind this approach is to select every unique distance and their corrosponding 
      elevation from a river inside a hillslope. If more than one raster cell have the same 
      distance the elevation is calculated by a weighted mean using the flow accumulation. The 
      hillslope width can be estimated by the frequency of the appearance of a single distance.
